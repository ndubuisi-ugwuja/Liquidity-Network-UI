# DeFi Liquidity Network UI

A decentralized web application that allows users to supply, withdraw, borrow, and repay assets such as ETH, WETH, USDC, and LINK through Aave Protocol v3 smart contracts.
This project is built with Next.js (React 18) and leverages ethers.js, wagmi, and RainbowKit for seamless wallet connectivity and blockchain interaction.

## üöÄ Overview

**This project** demonstrates how to build **a full DeFi frontend** that interfaces with **on-chain lending protocols** in a secure and modular way.

Users can:

- Connect their wallet (via RainbowKit / Wagmi / Viem)
- Supply **ETH** and **WETH** as collateral
- Earn interests on supplied collateral
- Withdraw assets safely back to their wallet
- Borrow against supplied collateral
- Repay borrowed assets
- View detailed account health and analytics
